# JohnDayRiverWaypoints
Official BLM campsite waypoints for the John Day Wild and Scenic River

These waypoints mark officially identified campsites along the popular stretches of the John Day River in Central Oregon. The data were scanned from the publication "John Day River Recreation Guide, Kimberly to Tumwater Falls" available from the Bureau of Land Management, and converted to WGS84 decimal degrees. I highly recommend that you buy this invaluable guide, which has detailed topographical maps of the river, printed on waterproof paper, in a convenient size.

The location data were originally in UTM, Zone 10 North and were converted to WGS84 degrees using the spreadsheet available at https://giscrack.com/download-excel-template-convert-geographic-coordinates-utm/

They were then converted to .gpx file format using the on line converter available at http://www.gcgpx.cz/?lang=en

Camp sites are labeled with River Mile and R or L for right or left bank, going downstream.

When the location data are plotted, it is clear that some have significant errors, estimated to be as much as 100 meters in some cases, so the coordinates should be viewed as a rough guide only. I double checked the conversions in several cases, using alternative calculators, and conclude that the original UTM coordinates are themselves in error.

Have fun!
