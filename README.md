# JohnDayRiverWaypoints
Campsite waypoints with GPS coordinates on the John Day Wild and Scenic River

These waypoints (146 of them!) mark officially identified campsites along 111 miles of the officially designated Wild and Scenic stretches of the John Day River in Central Oregon. The data were scanned from the publication "John Day River Recreation Guide, Kimberly to Tumwater Falls" available from the Bureau of Land Management, and converted to WGS84 decimal degrees. 

If you plan on floating the Wild and Scenic stretches, I highly recommend that you buy this invaluable guide, which has detailed topographical maps of the river, printed on waterproof paper, in a convenient size.

**METHODS**

The location data were originally scanned in from the BLM river guide in UTM Northing and Easting, NAD27 Zone 10 North and were converted to WGS84 degrees using the program ExpertGPS. Output files are JD_campsites in .csv or .kml (Google Earth format).

Camp sites are **labeled** with River Mile and R or L for right or left bank, going downstream, as shown in the River Guide.

**NOTES** 

Github does not support the .gpx or .kml file extension, so the files with those extensions are zipped and posted below.

Have fun floating!
