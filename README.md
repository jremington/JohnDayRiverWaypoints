# JohnDayRiverWaypoints
Campsite waypoints with GPS coordinates on the John Day Wild and Scenic River

These waypoints (146 of them!) mark officially identified campsites along 111 miles of the officially designated Wild and Scenic stretches of the John Day River in Central Oregon. The data were scanned from the publication "John Day River Recreation Guide, Kimberly to Tumwater Falls" available from the Bureau of Land Management, and converted to WGS84 decimal degrees. 

If you plan on floating the Wild and Scenic stretches, I highly recommend that you buy this invaluable guide, which has detailed topographical maps of the river, printed on waterproof paper, in a convenient size.

**METHODS**

The location data were originally scanned in from the BLM river guide in UTM, NAD27 Zone 10 North and were converted to WGS84 degrees using the spreadsheet available at https://giscrack.com/download-excel-template-convert-geographic-coordinates-utm/

The location data were then further converted to waypoints in .gpx file format using the on line converter available at http://www.gcgpx.cz/?lang=en

Camp sites are **labeled** with River Mile and R or L for right or left bank, going downstream, as shown in the River Guide.

**NOTES** 

(1) When the location data are plotted, for example on Google Earth, it is clear that some locations have significant errors, estimated to be as much as 100 meters, and may even appear to be on the wrong side of the river (trust the waypoint label R or L!) so the coordinates should be viewed as a guide only. The Datum is UTM zone 10 NAD27 CONUS, and I have not been able to find a calculator for UTM to NAD27. It helps a lot to set the GPS to NAD27, but the coordinates are still not quite correct.

(2) Github does not support the .gpx file extension, so the files below with .txt extensions should be renamed to .gpx for uploading to your device.

Have fun floating!
